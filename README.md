# Research Assistant

That is the documentation of my role as a research assistant at ITB Astronomy with the research title "Tracing Disk Instability in MAXI J1820+070 with MAXI/GSC, Swift/XRT, and NuSTAR". I am responsible for, but not limited to, data cleaning, data processing (including its visualization), and report formulation. The main tools I use are HeaSOFT (X-ray astronomy data analysis software) and Python.
