# Research Assistant

That is the documentation of my role as a research assistant at ITB Astronomy with the research title "Tracing Disk Instability in MAXI J1820+070 with MAXI/GSC, Swift/XRT, and NuSTAR". I am responsible for, but not limited to, data cleaning, data processing (including visualization), and report formulation. The tools that I used are HeaSOFT (X-ray astronomy data analysis software), Python, and Microsoft Excel.
